# Prevent access of any sensitive files stored within webroot by blocking access well known sensitive files and file types.
# This snippet tries to be false positive free, but it may have poor coverage as a result. Ideally, you shouldn't place sensive files in webroot,
# but this snippet is good to have just in case you did so by mistake.

# Add the code below in your server block to block access to known sensitive files
# include /etc/nginx/snippets/protect-sensitive-files.conf;

# Block known sensitive file types
# Most of the file extensions here is borrowed from OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
